RoboFarm Greenhouse Automation, Irrigation Automation, and Poultry Farm Automation with Arduino and Raspberry Pi 

Long story short, aÂ few years ago (in 2017 i think), a guy criticized the graphical interface.

At that moment I realized that he has to be a part of the team. 

So the GUI look and feel by Alex Hodorogea 

The PHP GUI (HTML folder) is in the Romanian language. Would be translated at some stage (too busy nowadays).


The sql file contains the MySQL/MariaDB SQL database structure


The default username is admin password admin 

For those who want more than a test, the PCB Layout is available for printing under CeresOne folder.

Initially, I gave up the name RoboFarm, because so many projects with this name. Feel free to name it as you pleased.

Under CeresOne/Resources you can see the pieces of the schematics, and how the power source and PCB board were designed. 

The project can work with a radio module with some software modifications.

Feel free to use it as you pleased. 

First version based on Arduino Mega with Google Docs logs  in production on 2015 :

png folder contains the new (actual) GUI version.


The system is designed to reduce farming costs and effort.

I hope that there would be a very happy farmer. 

The system was designed to help my uncle and every farmer that might need a bit of "help".

RoboFarm can be the best employee, he can ventilate the farm at 5AM if necessary.
