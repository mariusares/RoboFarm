# RoboFarm
RoboFarm Grenhouse, Irrigation and Poultry Farm with Arduino and Raspberry Pi 

Long story short, few years ago (in 2017 i think), a guy criticised the graphical interface.

On that moment I realised that he has to be a part of the team. 

So the GUI look and feel by Alex Hodorogea 

The php GUI (html folder) is on Romanian language. Would be translated at some stage (too bussy nowdays).


The sql file contains the MySQL/MariaDB SQL database structure


The default username is admin password admin 


For those who want more than a test, the PCB Layout is available for printing under CeresOne folder.

Initially i gived up the name RoboFarm, because so many project with this name. Feel free to name it as you pleased.

Under CeresOne/Resources you can see the pieces of the schematics, how the power source and PCB board was designed. 

The project can work with a radio module with some software modifications.

Fell free to use it as you pleased.
